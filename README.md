# Advent of Change

Here I try to solve all programming puzzles from the 2017 advent of code. The big catch is that I will use a different language each day. I should also try to seek out new languages and not use too many I already use a lot.


## Ideas for languages:

### Imperative
- FORTRAN
- Pascal (Free Pascal)
- Bash
- x86 Assembly

### Object Oriented
- ~~Simula~~
- ~~SmallTalk~~
- C++
- Ruby
- Kotlin
- C#

### Logic
- Prolog

### Functional
- OCaml
- Erlang
- Elixir
- PureScript
- Scala
- Haskell (Parsec)

### Array based
- Excel
- ~~APL~~

### Meme
- Piet

### Multi paradigm
- Common Lisp
- Nim
- Go
- TypeScript
- Julia		(multiple dispatch?)
- Lua 		(scripting mainly)
- Perl
- Raku 		(Perl)
- R		(Statistical)
- JavaScript	(Maybe too alike?)
- Pen and paper


## Problem to language map

A thing to note is that day 1 is a friday and that weekends tend to be the hardest.

1. Circular lists - Piet
2. Row checksums - Excel
3. Spiral distances - Pascal
4. Valid passphrases - Bash
5. Jump offsets - x86
6. Memory reallocation - ~~Simula~~ ~~SmallTalk~~ Kotlin
7. Balancing towers - Prolog
8. Register operations - Perl
9. Stream parsing - Haskell (Parsec)
10. Circular list manipulation for hashing - JavaScript
11. Hex grid distances - ~~APL?~~ R
12. Communication graph - Ruby
13. Simulating moving scanners - ~~Fortran?~~ Common Lisp
14. Grid hashings - Erlang
15. Comapring generators - Fortran
