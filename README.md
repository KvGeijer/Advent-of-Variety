# Advent of Change

Here I try to solve all programming puzzles from the 2017 advent of code. The big catch is that I will use a different language each day. I should also try to seek out new languages and not use too many I already use a lot.

## Ideas for languages:

### Imperative
- FO:RTRAN
- BASIC
- Pascal
- WebAssembly (?)
- Bash
- Assembly (x86?)

### Object Oriented
- Simula
- C++
- Ruby
- Kotlin
- C#

### Logic
- Prolog

### Functional
- OCaml
- Erlang
- Elixir
- PureScript

### Array based
- Excel		(no VBA)
- APL

### Multi paradigm
- Nim
- Go
- TypeScript
- Julia		(multiple dispatch?)
- Lua 		(scripting mainly)
- Raku 		(Perl)
- R		(Statistical)
- JavaScript	(Maybe too alike?)
