## Day 6 - Kotlin

Here I first wanted to do some old object oriented language, but when I did not get Simula working I got a bit put off and instead decided to use Kotlin. The day itself was quite easy, but relied on a hashmap which is not necessarily included in all standard libraries. Thus it was nice to use Kotlin which is a modern language with a large library.

## Impression of Kotlin

Kotlin is quite nice and I can see why people use it. It is basically Java, but with more modern ideas, such as skipping semicolons and building a bit more on functional programming. I think that where this really shines is in actual products which it seems very developed for. Even on its webpage it seems more like a tool to develop products than a stand alone language. So if you want to create a product which is good for Kotlin I would consider using it, but otherwise I would probably rather use Scala (which seems very similar).
