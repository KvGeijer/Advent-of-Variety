## Day 8 - Perl

This day relied on having access to a dictionary and then iterating over a bunch of easily parsed instrutions. I chose Perl as it is modern and I heard to was good at handling strings. However, I soon realized that the string manipulation needed was very basic.

## Impressions of Perl

If shell code is a normal dude with ugly clothes and a messy beard, then Perl to me feels like if the dude took a bunch of steroids and got a good shave. It seems to have a bunch of good utilities and it is more pleasant to write and look at than shell code. But at the same time the structure is still very alike to some shell and the syntax feels clunky in places. For example having to put $ before each scalar variable feels a bit unnecessary.
