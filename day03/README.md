## Day 3 - Pascal

Part 1 was fun as you could do a nice mathematical solution instead of actually doing a loop. I had some problems with reading the input correctly when piping (newline being included sometimes but oonly for large numbers), but when piping a file it worked good.

Part 2 was a bit of a bummer. In a way it was fun to do a mutidimensional array and some loops in Pascal, but the solution was just computing the values, without any trickery.

## Impression of Pascal

Quite nice language. It was fun to see it enforced the definitions of variables at the top of a function, like C did in the past. It gave me some flash backs to my course in compilers. For what I did it felt very much like C, but a bit less freedom. The most interesting part was how the code had to be formatted which was fun to see.

I used the Free Pascal compiler to run my code. It worked very smoothly.
