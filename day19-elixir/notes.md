# Elixir

The pipes were nice, but not as nice as in Zote. Also clunky way to get arount \>>. Finally, the functions were not always designed for pipes it felt like. Overall, the pipes were nice :D

The syntax is strange, and I don't like the end invocations. Just use {..} in this case... You can see the Erlang reskin, but in many ways this feels more clean
