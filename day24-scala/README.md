# Day 24 - Scala

A nice day, boiling down to traverse a graph in search for some optimal path without cycles. The hardest part seemed to be parsing the input into a mapping in a nice way. Surprisingly easy for day 24, which often tends to be way too hard for us Swedes...

## Thoughts on Scala

Maybe it was just the day being easy and nice, but wow was this a breeze! Once understanding some basics, the flow of writing in Scala felt natural and easy. Perhaps the only annoyance was that I had a relatively hard time googling specific Scala functions. The resources I found online felt lackluster. However, that is not the fault of the language. I wonder why Scala never really took off.
