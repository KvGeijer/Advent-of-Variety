## Day 15 - Fortran

I really thought this was some tricky problem with a required optimization trick, but turns our brute force is ok for speed. Part 2 required me to change the deepest function, but the solution with masks I thought was quite clever.

## Impressions of Fortran

In many ways Fortran felt a lot more modern than I had expected, such as the printing and reading of values. But in some ways it felt very archaic, like the syntax for function bodies. But the idea with specifying intents for subroutines was very nice for example.

This day did not showcase any matrices, which is where I assume Fortran would outshine C, so that is a bit sad. I also did no experiments with custom types.

Overall it was a positive experience, with a more modern feeling than I expected. But it felt cluttered in some ways and a bit clunky. But I can see why this would be used in many numerical computation libraries.
