I decided to use Steel Bank Common Lisp, as it seemed quite standard. It seems most LISP programmers use Emacs with some nice integration. But I skip any IDE as I will just do a small file.

I enhoyed the different ways to enter parameters. You can have required, named (key) as well as optional. A quite clear solution and distinction between them.
