##Day 13 - Common Lisp

The day was quite straight forward really. I got a bit annoyed at the second part as it completely got rid of the severity measure, making me have to add a clunky mapping. In the start I also thought we would have to do some smart maths to optimze it, since 40 million loop iterations is alot, but that was not the case...

## Impressions of Common Lisp

I had used Clojure once before, so I already was slightly familiar with the syntax, which I quite dislike. All the parentheses just become so annoying and clutters the code. But well written code is probably better to look at than mine. I felt like some function composition like haskell would have been nice, but maybe you can actually get that to work...

I decided to use Steel Bank Common Lisp, as it seemed quite standard. It seemed uite common to use EMACS as an IDE for this, but I wanted to learn Helix, so I just used the basic REPL. It was fine, but a bit annoying that you could not immediately repeat commands ot go back in the text. I think I would have enjoyed programming much more if it was easy to export individual code from the main file to the shell. 

I enhoyed the different ways to enter parameters. You can have required, named (key) as well as optional. Overall I guess that that is the strength of the language, it can be extended and modified in a seamless manner. This is quite neat and it would be fun to try that out for real sometime. I think that is my final conclusion. It is a bit wonky and ugly looking, but if you have a good workflow setup and know the language well it is probably very enjoyable to use.
