## Day 12 - Ruby

I think this was a very nice simple day where the problem was to find connected components of a graph, as well as to parse the graph. The code turned out pretty nice with the object oriented nature of Ruby.

## Impressions of Ruby

Initially I was very sceptical of Ruby, thinking it was more like Perl. But it turns out I enjoyed it quite a bit. I did get one really strange error where I tried to access index 0 and 780 in a 780 long list (last index will be 789), where __both__ elements became Nil instead of just teh second one. But other than that I enjoyed the language. The syntax was clean and the standard library functions where intuitive. I could definetely see that this is a popular and usefull language.
