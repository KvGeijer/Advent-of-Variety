## Day 3 - Bash

This day was actually very nice to do in Bash, if you know the language. However I quickly realized I virtually knew nothing of Bash or sh in general. But after some googling I learnt some function like tr, xargs, sort and such. There are a lot of functions for manipulating strings here, you just have to know which to use and how to use them. 

Since some shell is available basically everywhere I feel I should have some knowledge of how to use it.

## Impression of Bash

It has a lot of quite high level functionality. But is definetely is not meant to be used as a complete programming language, more so something to do quick checks with or pipe around data between programs. This can for example be seen in how much charactes are needed to increment a counter. It was slow to run, but if you know it, fast to write.
