# Day 21 - Odin

After not doing any AoC for half a year, this day threw me for a loop. I designed the solution to use bitwise manipulation, mappings, and recursion. The idea was that it was suppesed to be very efficient, and be able to use memoization for part 2 if needed. However, I screwed up with the recursion first time, not realizing the periodicity of 3 instead of 2 for the swap between 3x3 and 2x2 rules.

## Impressions of Odin

This actually seems like a very nice take on C. It even has maps as part of the language, and a lot of the syntax feels very modern. From my short usage of it, it feels like a modernized C with both better syntax and namespaces. I don't think it will break through, but I would be happy to use it again in the future.
