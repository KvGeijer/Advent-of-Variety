# Day 23 - F#

This is one of these fun assembly days. For the first part, we had to write a very simple virtual machine. In the second part, we had to reverse engineer the program, and optimize it. I did this by re-writing the program, hand-optimizing the innermost loop in F#.

## Thoughts on F#

A surprisingly nice to use language, building on functional ideas, while still letting users write quite similarly to a imperative language. It seems to have most of the nice things one would expect of a functional language, including pattern matching and pipes. The syntax feels nice, and it is fun to write.
