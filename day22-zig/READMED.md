# Day 22 - Zig

A seemingly very straightforward day about rule-based simulation. The final solution takes a bit over 2 seconds, which is surprisingly slow for being written in a language like Zig. I wonder if there is something smart you are supposed to find, such as repeating cycles in the path...

## Impressions of Zig

Zig feels like a nice language. I can really see why people see it as a good alternative to C. It has good memory handling, as well as error propagation seemingly similar to Rust. It also has nicer syntax, methods, namespaces, and compile time generics. It feels pleasant to use, however, the errors were at times not very helpful (it has some catching up to do with Rust). If Rust is a modern approach of C++, I can absolutely see how this is a modernized C.
