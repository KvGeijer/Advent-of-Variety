## Day 11 - R

The hard part today was all about finding a pretty formula for the manhattan distance on a hexagonal grid. In the end I found one which I think is really simple and pretty which I was very happy with. It was nice that R quite easily could parse the indata. The code is almost only to read the input and convert it to the coordinates which is nice.

## Impressions of R

I can't give an honest review or opinion on R after this. It seems to have nice functions for parsing files such as csv which is nice, and its syntax was rather pleasant. I really loved that if statements return values, which is one of my favourite modern/functional language features. The standard functions were intuitive and worked well, so I can see this being a convenient language to use. If it has good plots I can see why people would say it can replace Matlab.
